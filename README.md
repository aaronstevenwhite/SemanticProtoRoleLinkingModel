# The Semantic Proto-Role Linking Model

## Overview

This package implements the Semantic Proto-Role Linking Model (SPROLIM), which is described in:

White, A. S., K. Rawlins, & B. Van Durme. (2017). [The Semantic Proto-Role Linking Model](http://aswhite.net/media/papers/white_semantic_2017.pdf). To appear in the Proceedings of 15th Conference of the European Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics. Valencia, Spain. April 3-7, 2017.

The model described in that paper has a strict subset of the features that are currently implemented. Default parameterizations will fit the model described there.

## Install
